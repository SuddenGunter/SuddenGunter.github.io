![Firefox on Arch](/assets/post1_title.jpg)
On my new laptop with i7-8750h, 16GB RAM, SSD and fresh Arch Linux - Firefox was laggy as hell. Whant to know why and how to fix it? 
<sub> (TLDR: install compton)</sub>

Recently I've purchased a new laptop: Dell XPS 9570.
I've installed Arch Linux, installed the same packages that I'd on my desktop system for several months, copied [dotfiles][dotfiles-github]

I'd chosen i3 as a window manager, without any DE or display managers.
I run it from bare `.xinitrc` with
{% highlight shell %}
exec /bin/i3
{% endhighlight %}

Chromium worked fine, everything worked fine - except Firefox. Sometimes, when I tried to scroll a page - Firefox freezed for 2..5 seconds. It was annoying, but I didn't want to spent any time fixing it at that moment.
And then the same issue started occuring in Telegram. 

I tried to find any info regarding this: maybe somebody had issues like and fixed it.
I'd encountered this:

>i3 does not properly implement double buffering hence tearing or flickering may occur. [See Compton.][arch-i3-tearing]

>So, the culprit was a recent kernel [issue with the Intel drivers][reddit-firefox-issue] ... a workaround is actually installing a composite manager

So, I'd installed compton, added this to `.config/i3/config`

{% highlight shell %}
exec --no-startup-id "compton -b -C -f --config /home/gunter/.config/compton/compton.conf"
{% endhighlight %}

Plus, created that `.config/compton/compton.conf` mentioned above.

As far as I can tell - compton fixed firefox and telegram lags, I guess it may be related to double-buffering, or some driver issue mentioned above.
But for now - it works perfectly.

**Update**: compton in Arch linux repos was replaced with [Picom][picom]
